Dear User,<br>
<br>
you receive this message because at {{ request.time_request | timestamp2isot }} ( {{ request.time_request | humanize_age  }} ago ) you submitted a request
for a {{ request.product_type }} (job_id: {{ request.job_id[:8] }}) from the service provided by {{ oda_site.site_name }} available at the URL {{ oda_site.frontend_url }}.<br>
<br>
{% if request.status == "submitted" %}
The request has been submitted, and once products will be ready, you will receive a new message.<br>
{% elif request.status == "done" %}
The platform have <b>finished</b> processing your request.<br>
{% if request.status_details_message %}
{{ request.status_details_message }}
{% endif %}

{% elif request.status == "failed" %}
Your request has <b>failed</b>. Sorry for that! You will be further contacted by our team.<br>
{% endif %}
<br>
{% if request.request_url != "" %}
You can inspect the status of your job using the following <a href="{{ request.request_url }}">url</a>.<br>
{% if request.permanent_url %}
Note that this url is permanent, and can be used to refer to the results as long as the service exists.<br>
{% else %}
Note that this url is <b>NOT</b> permanent, and will be valid until {{ request.decoded_token.exp | timestamp2isot }}.<br>
{% endif %}
Such link is intended for the recipient of this message, please do <b>NOT</b> share it, since this might contain sensitive information.<br>
<br>
{% else %}
You can retrieve the results by repeating the request.
Unfortunately, due to a known issue with very large requests, a URL with the selected request parameters could not be generated.
This might be fixed in a future release. You can retrieve your products by repeating the request.
{% endif -%}
You can also retrieve the result by repeating the request (either with frontend or with the python API query at the end of this message.).<br>
