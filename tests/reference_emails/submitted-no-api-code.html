<body>
Dear User,<br>
<br>
you receive this message because at 2021-08-19 17:43:15 ( 0.1 seconds ago ) you submitted a request <br>
for a numerical from the service provided by University of Geneva<br>
available at the URL PRODUCTS_URL.<br>
<br>

Once products will be ready, you will receive a new email.<br>

<br>

You can retrieve the results by repeating the request.
Unfortunately, due to a known issue with very large requests, a URL with the selected request parameters could not be generated.
This might be fixed in a future release. You can retrieve your products by repeating the request.
You can also retrieve the result by repeating the request (either with frontend or with the python API query).<br>
<br>
In case you have questions or issues you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@odahub.io">this email</a> or reply to the current message.<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
<br>
The ODA team.<br>
<br>


Please note the API code for this query was too large to embed it in the email text. Instead, we attach it as a python script.
If you think it was a nominal request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@odahub.io">this email</a> or reply to the current message, and we will try to resolve the problem as soon as possible.
