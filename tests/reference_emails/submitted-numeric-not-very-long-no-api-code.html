<body>
Dear User,<br>
<br>
you receive this message because at 2021-08-19 10:12:23 <IGNORES> you submitted a request <br>
for a numerical from the service provided by University of Geneva<br>
available at the URL PRODUCTS_URL.<br>
<br>

Once products will be ready, you will receive a new email.<br>

<br>

You can retrieve the results by repeating the request.
Unfortunately, due to a known issue with very large requests, a URL with the selected request parameters could not be generated.
This might be fixed in a future release. You can retrieve your products by repeating the request.
You can also retrieve the result by repeating the request (either with frontend or with the python API query).<br>

<br>
In case you have questions or issues you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@odahub.io">this email</a> or reply to the current message.<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
<br>
The ODA team.<br>
<br>


Please note that we were not able to embed API code in this email, since exceptionally, it was too large.
Our support team has been alerted about this incident.
However, a python script with the api code has been attached to this email.
If you think it was a nominal request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@odahub.io">this email</a> or reply to the current message, and we will try to resolve the problem as soon as possible.
